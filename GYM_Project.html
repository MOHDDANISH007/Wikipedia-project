      From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This article is about the indoor
      sports facility. For the fitness club, see Health club. For the school
      class known as "gym", see Physical education. For other uses, see Gym
      (disambiguation) and Gymnasium (disambiguation). Inside a gymnasium in
      Amsterdam A gym, short for gymnasium (pl.: gymnasiums or gymnasia), is an
      indoor venue for exercise and sports. The word is derived from the ancient
      Greek term "gymnasion".[1] They are commonly found in athletic and fitness
      centres, and as activity and learning spaces in educational institutions.
      "Gym" is also the commonly used name for a "fitness centre" or health
      club, which is often an area for indoor recreation. A "gym" may include or
      describe adjacent open air areas as well. In Western countries, "gyms"
      often describe places with indoor or outdoor courts for basketball,
      hockey, tennis, boxing or wrestling, and with equipment and machines used
      for physical development training, or to do exercises. In many European
      countries, Gymnasium (and variations of the word) also can describe a
      secondary school that prepares students for higher education at a
      university, with or without the presence of athletic courts, fields, or
      equipment.

      Gymnasium apparatus like barbells, jumping boards, running paths,
      tennis-balls, cricket fields, and fencing areas are used for exercises. In
      safe weather, outdoor locations are the most conducive to health.[2] Gyms
      were popular in ancient Greece. Their curricula included self-defense,
      gymnastics medica, or physical therapy to help the sick and injured, and
      for physical fitness and sports, from boxing to dancing to skipping
      rope.[3] Gymnasiums also had teachers of wisdom and philosophy. Community
      gymnastic events were done as part of the celebrations during various
      village festivals. In ancient Greece there was a phrase of contempt, "He
      can neither swim nor write." After a while, however, Olympic athletes
      began training in buildings specifically designed for them.[4] Community
      sports never became as popular among ancient Romans as it had among the
      ancient Greeks. Gyms were used more as a preparation for military service
      or spectator sports. During the Roman Empire, the gymnastic art was
      forgotten. In the Dark Ages there were sword fighting tournaments and of
      chivalry; and after gunpowder was invented sword fighting began to be
      replaced by the sport of fencing, as well as schools of dagger fighting
      and wrestling and boxing.[5] In the 18th century, Salzmann, a German
      clergyman, opened a gym in Thuringia teaching bodily exercises, including
      running and swimming. Clias and Volker established gyms in London, and in
      1825, Doctor Charles Beck, a German immigrant, established the first
      gymnasium in the United States. It was found that gym pupils lose interest
      in doing the same exercises, partly because of age. Variety in exercises
      included skating, dancing, and swimming. Some gym activities can be done
      by 6 to 8-year-olds, while age 16 has been considered mature enough for
      boxing and horseback riding.[6]

      In Ancient Greece, the gymnasion (γυμνάσιον) was a locality for both
      physical and intellectual education of young men. The latter meaning of
      intellectual education persisted in Greek, German and other languages to
      denote a certain type of school providing secondary education, the
      gymnasium, whereas in English the meaning of physical education pertained
      to the word 'gym'.[7] The Greek word gymnasion, which means "school for
      naked exercise," was used to designate a locality for the education of
      young men, including physical education (gymnastics, for example,
      exercise) which was customarily performed naked, as well as. bathing, and
      studies. For the Greeks, physical education was considered as important as
      cognitive learning. Most Greek gymnasia had libraries for use after
      relaxing in the baths.[citation needed] Nowadays, it represents a common
      area where people, from all ranges of experience, exercise and work out
      their muscles. You can also usually find people doing cardio exercises or
      pilates.

      The first recorded gymnasiums date back to over 3000 years ago in ancient
      Persia, where they were known as zurkhaneh, areas that encouraged physical
      fitness. The larger Roman Baths often had attached fitness facilities, the
      baths themselves sometimes being decorated with mosaics of local champions
      of sport. Gyms in Germany were an outgrowth of the Turnplatz,[8] an
      outdoor space for gymnastics founded by German educator Friedrich Jahn in
      1811[9] and later promoted by the Turners, a nineteenth-century political
      and gymnastic movement. The first American to open a public gym in the
      United States using Jahn's model was John Neal of Portland, Maine in
      1827.[10] The first indoor gymnasium in Germany was probably the one built
      in Hesse in 1852 by Adolph Spiess.[11] Through worldwide colonization,
      Great Britain expanded its national interest in sports and games to many
      countries. In the 1800s, programs were added to schools and college
      curricula that emphasized health, strength, and bodily measure. Sports
      drawn from European and British cultures thrived as college students and
      upper-class clubs financed competition. As a result, towns began building
      playgrounds that furthered interest in sports and physical activity.[12]
      Early efforts to establish gyms in the United States in the 1820s were
      documented and promoted by John Neal in the American Journal of
      Education[13] and The Yankee, helping to establish the American branch of
      the movement.[14] Later in the century, the Turner movement was founded
      and continued to thrive into the early twentieth century. The first
      Turners group was formed in London in 1848. The Turners built gymnasiums
      in several cities like Cincinnati and St. Louis, which had large German
      American populations. These gyms were utilized by adults and youth. For
      example, a young Lou Gehrig would frequent the Turner gym in New York City
      with his father.[15] Interior of a gym in the Netherlands, around 1900 The
      Boston Young Men's Christian Union claims to be "America's First Gym". The
      YMCA first organized in Boston in 1851 and a smaller branch opened in
      Rangasville in 1852.[16] Ten years later there were some two hundred YMCAs
      across the country, most of which provided gyms for exercise, games, and
      social interaction.[citation needed] The 1920s was a decade of prosperity
      that witnessed the building of large numbers of public high schools with a
      gymnasium, an idea founded by Nicolas Isaranga.[citation needed] Today,
      gymnasiums are commonplace in the United States. They are in virtually all
      U.S. colleges and high schools, as well as almost all middle schools and
      elementary schools. These facilities are used for physical education,
      intramural sports, and school gatherings. The number of gyms in the U.S.
      has more than doubled since the late 1980s.[17] Today, fitness gyms and
      private health clubs are a huge global business.[18]
